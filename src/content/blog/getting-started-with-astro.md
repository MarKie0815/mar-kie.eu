In this post, we'll explore how we migrated from WordPress to Astro for better performance and developer experience.

## Why We Chose Astro

After years of using WordPress, we decided it was time for a change. We wanted a modern, fast, and flexible solution that would allow us to build a high-performance website without the overhead of a traditional CMS.

Astro offered the perfect balance of features for our needs:

- Excellent performance with its "zero JS by default" approach
- Flexibility to use any UI framework (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
- Built-in support for Markdown content
- Simple and intuitive API
- Great developer experience

## The Migration Process

Migrating from WordPress to Astro involved several steps:

### 1. Exporting Content from WordPress

We used the WordPress REST API to export all our posts and pages as JSON. This gave us a clean data source to work with.

### 2. Setting Up the Astro Project

We created a new Astro project and set up the basic structure, including layouts, components, and styles.

### 3. Converting Content to Markdown

We converted our WordPress content to Markdown files, which Astro can process natively. This involved parsing the HTML content and transforming it into Markdown syntax.

### 4. Recreating Templates and Components

We recreated our WordPress templates and components in Astro, taking advantage of Astro's component-based architecture.

### 5. Setting Up Deployment

Finally, we set up a deployment pipeline to build and deploy our Astro site to a modern hosting platform.

## The Results

The results of our migration have been impressive:

- Page load times decreased by over 70%
- Lighthouse scores improved significantly
- Development workflow is much smoother
- Content management is simpler and more developer-friendly

## Conclusion

Moving from WordPress to Astro has been a game-changer for our website. We've gained performance, flexibility, and a better development experience. If you're considering a similar move, we highly recommend giving Astro a try.
